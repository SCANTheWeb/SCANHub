# SCANHub repository

This repo is to be used as a way to store and pass on all useful files relative to the SCAN The Web option.
Throughout the course of the class, if you acquire new files, upload them here.

## Directories

In some directories of the repo, you'll find other README files which explain how to use the related files. Use these instructions, improve them and create new ones where needed, but do not delete them unless they don't serve a purpose anymore.
